Hello there!

I currently work as a data analyst at Raiffeisen, a large retail bank in
Switzerland. Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a
Master's degree in Quantitative Economics and Finance from the University of St.
Gallen. During my studies I also worked as a research assistant for professor
[Charles Gottlieb](https://sites.google.com/site/gottliebcharles/Charles-Gottlieb) 
and professor [Beatrix Eugster](https://www.beatrixeugster.ch/).

I have extensive experience in cleaning, analysing and visualizing data, as
well as programming in general. I am also enthusiastic about the development
and application of econometric methods.
